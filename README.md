# Prediction of Autism in Kids

The Project Prediction of Autism in Kids was undertaken as a course project as part of the MLOps and ML System Design Course during Term 5 at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. The project was completed under the guidance of  Prof. Manaranjan Pradhan.
-- Project Status: Completed

## Objective:
The purpose of this project is predict the presence of autism in toddlers below the age of 36 months. 
Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. 
The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. This autism screening of toddlers contains influential features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, ten behavioural features (Q-Chat-10) plus other individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science, have been taken.

## Methodology Used:
1. Data Profiling
2. Exploratory Analysis & Feature Engineering
3. Building Machine Learning Models
4. Model Experiments 
5. Model Deployment
6. Model Monitoring and Explainability 

## Technologies:
1. Python and Python Packages (Numpy, pandas, scikitlearn, seaborn, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras etc)
2. Weights and Biases, for Experiment tracking
3. Google Colab
4. Gradio, for UI

## Problem and Dataset Overview:
The dataset we have taken for predicting ASD syndrome consists of 1054 children in the age group of 12-36 months. Out of the 1054 observations, there are a total of 728 positive class (i.e., children having ASD traits and requiring further medical care). There are a total number of 18 variables (including the output variable). The remaining variables are of categorical nature and form the crux of the dataset. The categorical variables which make up the bulk of total variables, namely A1-A10, are subjective behavioural questions that have been answered about the childrenâ€™s emotional development.
