Description : Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. This autism screening of toddlers contains influential features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, ten behavioural features (Q-Chat-10) plus other individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science, have been taken
